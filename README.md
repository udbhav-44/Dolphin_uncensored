# An Uncensored LLM - "Ask what shall you seek ?"

LLMs have taken over the world, there are many Language Models on the internet to play around,the most Famous being **ChatGPT** , other not so well known LLMs are Claude, Mistral, Falcon, Llama, Vicuna etc.

As it is very intresting to use these AI agents to solve our queries, they are certain restrictions while using them, namely, **Censorship**, which means the LLM will not answer certain queries which it deems unethical, violent, or in any ways different from the societal laws, which were set into it during its training.

***But What if we remove these restrictions and get an Uncensored LLM to answer our queries ?***


So we present an **read-to-use** notebook so run such an LLM on Google Collab (You can run it on your Local Machine as well if you have enough computation power ;) . )

> **Please Note:** 
> This model is uncensored, and will answer any questions you put to it. You are the sole author of any content that you generate with it. Enjoy responsibly. Do not put dolphin in charge of any robot production facilities.
